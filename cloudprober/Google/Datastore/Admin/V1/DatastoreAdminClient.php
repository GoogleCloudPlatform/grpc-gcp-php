/**
 * Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
 *
 * The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ## Concepts
 *
 * Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google Cloud Datastore
 * API.
 *
 * Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
 *
 * EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
 * specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
 * may be all).
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ## Services
 *
 * # Export/Import
 *
 * The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
 * entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
 *
 * Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
 * Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
 * possible to export from one project and then import into another.
 *
 * Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
 *
 * Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
 * created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
 * of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
 *
 * # Index
 *
 * The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
 *
 * Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
 * An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
 * The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
 * may be queried via the Operation resource.
 *
 * # Operation
 *
 * The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
 * specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
 * created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
 *
 * An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel is
 * asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after the
 * request to cancel is made.
 *
 * An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
 * part of the Operation collection.
 *
 * ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed operations.
 *
 * Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin,
 * but are accessed via service google.longrunning.Operations.
