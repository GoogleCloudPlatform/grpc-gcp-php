/**
 * A read alignment describes a linear alignment of a string of DNA to a
 * [reference sequence][google.genomics.v1.Reference], in addition to metadata
 * about the fragment (the molecule of DNA sequenced) and the read (the bases
 * which were read by the sequencer). A read is equivalent to a line in a SAM
 * file. A read belongs to exactly one read group and exactly one
 * [read group set][google.genomics.v1.ReadGroupSet].
 * For more genomics resource definitions, see [Fundamentals of Google
 * Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics)
 * ### Reverse-stranded reads
 * Mapped reads (reads having a non-null `alignment`) can be aligned to either
 * the forward or the reverse strand of their associated reference. Strandedness
 * of a mapped read is encoded by `alignment.position.reverseStrand`.
 * If we consider the reference to be a forward-stranded coordinate space of
 * `[0, reference.length)` with `0` as the left-most position and
 * `reference.length` as the right-most position, reads are always aligned left
 * to right. That is, `alignment.position.position` always refers to the
 * left-most reference coordinate and `alignment.cigar` describes the alignment
 * of this read to the reference from left to right. All per-base fields such as
 * `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` share this same left-to-right
 * orientation; this is true of reads which are aligned to either strand. For
 * reverse-stranded reads, this means that `alignedSequence` is the reverse
 * complement of the bases that were originally reported by the sequencing
 * machine.
 * ### Generating a reference-aligned sequence string
 * When interacting with mapped reads, it's often useful to produce a string
 * representing the local alignment of the read to reference. The following
 * pseudocode demonstrates one way of doing this:
 *     out = ""
 *     offset = 0
 *     for c in read.alignment.cigar {
 *       switch c.operation {
 *       case "ALIGNMENT_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH":
 *         out += read.alignedSequence[offset:offset+c.operationLength]
 *         offset += c.operationLength
 *         break
 *       case "CLIP_SOFT", "INSERT":
 *         offset += c.operationLength
 *         break
 *       case "PAD":
 *         out += repeat("*", c.operationLength)
 *         break
 *       case "DELETE":
 *         out += repeat("-", c.operationLength)
 *         break
 *       case "SKIP":
 *         out += repeat(" ", c.operationLength)
 *         break
 *       case "CLIP_HARD":
 *         break
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return out
 * ### Converting to SAM's CIGAR string
 * The following pseudocode generates a SAM CIGAR string from the
 * `cigar` field. Note that this is a lossy conversion
 * (`cigar.referenceSequence` is lost).
 *     cigarMap = {
 *       "ALIGNMENT_MATCH": "M",
 *       "INSERT": "I",
 *       "DELETE": "D",
 *       "SKIP": "N",
 *       "CLIP_SOFT": "S",
 *       "CLIP_HARD": "H",
 *       "PAD": "P",
 *       "SEQUENCE_MATCH": "=",
 *       "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH": "X",
 *     }
 *     cigarStr = ""
 *     for c in read.alignment.cigar {
 *       cigarStr += c.operationLength + cigarMap[c.operation]
 *     }
 *     return cigarStr
